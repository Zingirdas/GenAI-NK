Please create a script in Python where AI has access to two tools:
1. read_from_file -> the tool would allow to read from a local .txt file.
2. write_to_file -> the tool which would allow writing to files.

The task would be to have an AI agent which would be able to answer questions about your home city.
For example, mine is Birzai.

1. Go to english wikipedia of your home town. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bir%C5%BEai
2. copy text from wiki page and paste it into your birzai.txt file.
3. Write a workflow which would make 2 tool completions:
    3.1. Read from file about my home city. 
    3.2. Write a short summary of your home-town into a file.
